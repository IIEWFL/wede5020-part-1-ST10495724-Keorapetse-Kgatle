Purpose and Impact
This website displays that superior design can be both emotional and professional. It meets the academic requirements while laying the foundation for something that could grow and help more people.
Many domestic workers and gardeners struggle to use digital tools. Some lack access to devices, others find the language too difficult, and many encounter websites that aren’t designed with their needs in mind. Most platforms ignore their emotional experiences, leaving them feeling excluded and unsupported.
Bright Nation was created to change that. It’s a simple and welcoming website that centres real-life experiences first. The goal is to help users feel seen, supported, and empowered through thoughtful design.
Personal Reflection
This project taught me how to balance emotion and function. I had to make things easy to use without losing warmth and respect. I focused on clean HTML, clear navigation, and sharp contrast to make the site accessible for users with low digital literacy. Every section was designed with empathy and clarity, ensuring that even first-time users could navigate with confidence.
