Bright Nation is a digital platform created to support and uplift  domestic workers and gardeners.The goal is to help them feel confident,included,and emotionally supported through  kind messages and easy to use design.This project presents a basic HTML website that is clear,warm,and simple even for users with limited digital skills.The site includes a welcoming home page,a Program page,a contact page ,and a about page with a special section with affirmations to help users feel strong and valued.It also provides contact details for organizations or individuals who want to patner with us to uplift communities.This project shows that good designcan be both emotional and proffessional.It meets academic requirements while also laying the foundation for something that could grow and help more people in real life.Many domestic workers and gardeners often struggle to use digital tools and some don't have access to devices,others find the language too difficult,and many face websites that arent designed  with their needs in mind.Most platforms ignore their emotional experiences,leaving them feeling left out and unsupported.
Bright nation was created to change that .Its a simple and  welcoming website that centres real life experiences first.The goal is to help users feel seen ,supported,and empowered through thoughtful design.
This project taught me how to balance emotion and function .I had to make things easy to use without losing warmth and respect.I focused on clean HTML ,clear navigation ,and strong contrast to make the site accessible for users with low digital literacy.
