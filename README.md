This website displays that superior design can be both emotional and professional. It meets the academic requirements while laying the foundation for something that could grow and help more people.
Many domestic workers and gardeners struggle to use digital tools. Some lack access to devices, others find the language too difficult, and many encounter websites that aren’t designed with their needs in mind. Most platforms ignore their emotional experiences, leaving them feeling excluded and unsupported.
Bright Nation was created to change that. It’s a simple and welcoming website that centres real-life experiences first. The goal is to help users feel seen, supported, and empowered through thoughtful design.
